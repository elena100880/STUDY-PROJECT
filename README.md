**Dockerfile**

Docker-compose.yaml file in the project folder uses an official image php:7.4-apache.

Also, you can use my Dockerfile from rep: https://github.com/elena100880/dockerfile.

It includes php:8.0-apache official image (or you can change it to php:7.4-apache) and the installation of Composer, XDebug for VSC, Nano, some PHP extensions and enabling using mod rewrite (so you can skip index.php in URLs).

Execute the following commands:

  + `docker build . -t php:8.0-apache-xdebug` in the folder with Dockerfile.
  + `docker run -p -d 80:80 -v "$PWD":/var/www -w="/var/www" php:8.0-apache-xdebug composer install` in the project folder.
